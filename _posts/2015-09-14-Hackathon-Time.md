# Hackathon Time! #

I'm actually really looking forward to the hackathon tomorrow. I plan to spend some time working with Office Javascript API and will get a jump on my Agile Life Managment project. 

The overall idea of the project is simple...build a system for managing the activities I should be focusing on based on a book I read a long time ago called The 10 Natural Laws of Successful Time and Life Management.
